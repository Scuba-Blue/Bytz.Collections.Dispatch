## Issue

If-then-else blocks are cumbersome and also require a lot of repetitive executions by a developer and qa testing time in order to troubleshoot.   

Being able to consolidate conditions (rules) into a testable container would increase software product quality without ever calling any method call or function return.

## Features

* Conciseness of the definition of if-then-else conditions.
* Ability to test  logical branching without having to create dependent instance trees.
* Potential performance increases could be attained by the _order_ that conditions are defined.
* Simpify understanding of boolean conditons to programmers conversant with LinQ expressions.
* Allow testing of boolean conditions without executing code that may call complex calculations, make calls to databases, etc.
